# Self-Contained ERP MVP Narrative Blueprint

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy
Enterprise resource planning systems have long promised a unified view of business operations, yet they often arrive chained to heavy infrastructure, recurring subscription fees, and opaque integration points. The Minimum Viable Product described in this blueprint aims to reclaim control by delivering an ERP that is self-contained, offline-capable, and transparent in both configuration and operation. The guiding philosophy is that organizations should be able to deploy a fully functional system on their own terms, whether that means a single laptop in a small office or an on-premise server in a mid-sized manufacturing plant. 

The narrative format of this document purposely intertwines architecture, rationale, and anticipated trade-offs. Rather than simply listing features, each section explores why certain decisions were made and how they serve the overarching goal of autonomy. At roughly 3,500 words, the blueprint strives to provide enough detail for a development team to begin implementation, while leaving room for iterative refinement. The MVP focuses on core financial and operational processes that underpin most businesses, intentionally excluding specialized modules like payroll, tax engines, or manufacturing scheduling to keep the scope manageable for an initial release.

The system’s independence from external services does not equate to isolationist design. Instead, the intention is to build a foundational platform with clear extension points, allowing future integrations to be added in a controlled manner. By treating offline capability as a primary requirement, the MVP enforces a disciplined approach to packaging dependencies, managing state, and providing embedded documentation. Users are not assumed to have constant internet access, which influences everything from database choice to help-system delivery. The resulting product is a hybrid between modern usability expectations and traditional software distribution models.

## 2. System Architecture
The architecture is organized into four layers: Presentation, Application, Data, and Integration. Each layer has a distinct responsibility, and interactions are governed by explicit interfaces rather than implicit dependencies. This layered approach promotes maintainability and allows developers to reason about system behavior without navigating a tangled web of cross-cutting concerns.

The Presentation layer encompasses all user-facing components, including forms, dashboards, and embedded help panels. It is deliberately minimalistic, favoring clarity over flashy UI elements. The MVP envisions a desktop-style interface delivered through a lightweight web server bundled with the application or a standalone desktop app using a framework like Electron. The key requirement is that all assets—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images—are packaged locally so the system can operate without external calls. Tooltips and contextual help draw from a built-in documentation store, satisfying the offline requirement while keeping the user experience friendly.

The Application layer hosts the business logic. Here, services handle workflows such as posting a journal entry, approving a vendor invoice, or fulfilling a sales order. The codebase is structured into modules that mirror the functional domains described later in this blueprint. Inter-module communication uses internal APIs defined within the application boundary, ensuring that responsibilities remain well delineated. The MVP intentionally avoids message queues or external brokers; instead, synchronous method calls and database transactions suffice for the expected load.

The Data layer is the backbone of the system. A relational database, chosen for its ACID guarantees, houses all master data and transactional records. SQLite serves as the default engine for single-user or evaluation deployments, offering simplicity and zero-configuration start-up. PostgreSQL is recommended for production, especially when multi-user access, concurrency control, and advanced indexing are required. Schema migrations are versioned and executed at startup, allowing the application to upgrade itself without manual intervention. Tables include audit fields capturing creation and modification metadata, supporting traceability across the system.

The Integration layer, despite the self-contained ethos, provides internal APIs that expose functionality to other modules or potential future extensions. These APIs use simple HTTP or in-process function calls, depending on deployment mode. External integrations are not part of the MVP, but the architecture anticipates their eventual inclusion by maintaining clean contracts at module boundaries. In essence, the system is internally service-oriented while remaining packaged as a single artifact.

An offline-first stance yields notable trade-offs. Without a built-in path to horizontal scaling, the MVP relies on vertical performance tuning and disciplined transaction handling. Yet the benefit is deterministic behavior: with all components under direct control, administrators can reproduce environments, perform backups, and audit data without chasing down cloud dependencies. Documentation, icon libraries, and even sample datasets are all included in the distribution, ensuring that a fresh installation is immediately usable.

## 3. General Ledger (GL)
The General Ledger module anchors the financial integrity of the ERP. It implements strict double-entry bookkeeping, meaning every transaction must balance debits and credits. The Chart of Accounts (COA) is configurable and hierarchical, allowing organizations to tailor account structures to their reporting needs. Each account carries attributes such as type (asset, liability, equity, income, expense), parent account reference, and default posting rules. 

Journal entries are the atomic units of financial data. A journal entry records the posting date, a unique identifier, the accounts affected, debit and credit amounts, a memo or description, and links to source documents where applicable. To preserve immutability, posted entries cannot be edited in place; corrections are made through reversing or adjusting entries, each leaving a clear audit trail. Supporting suspense accounts enable temporary holding of transactions that are awaiting clarification, ensuring that the books remain balanced even when operational data lags behind.

The GL provides several key reports, including Trial Balance, Profit & Loss, and Balance Sheet. These reports derive directly from posted journal entries, guaranteeing alignment with the official ledger. The system supports both manual journal entries and automated postings from sub-ledgers like Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory. During month-end close, users may perform a soft close, which locks a period for edits but allows reopening, or a hard close, which permanently seals the period. The close process includes validation checks for unposted or unbalanced entries, helping accountants catch errors before finalizing financial statements.

Designing the GL as the foundation enables consistent financial semantics across modules. By enforcing that every operational event—goods receipt, customer invoice, vendor payment—ultimately produces a journal entry, the ERP ensures that financial and operational views remain reconciled. This discipline reduces the risk of data inconsistencies and simplifies auditing, as each transaction can be traced through the system back to the ledger.

## 4. Accounts Payable (AP)
The Accounts Payable module manages the company’s obligations to vendors. Each vendor has a master record containing contact information, payment terms, default expense or asset accounts, and optional tax details. Vendor onboarding includes verification steps and an approval workflow to prevent rogue suppliers from entering the system.

AP workflows begin with the entry of a purchase invoice. The invoice references a purchase order and goods receipt when applicable, ensuring that billing aligns with actual deliveries. Multi-step approvals can be configured based on invoice amount thresholds, reducing fraud risk. Once approved, the invoice is posted to the GL, typically debiting an expense or inventory account and crediting Accounts Payable. The system supports credit notes for returned goods or pricing disputes, automatically adjusting outstanding balances.

Payment processing handles checks, bank transfers, or cash disbursements. Each payment can cover one or multiple invoices and may include partial payments. Payment runs generate proposals based on due dates and available cash, allowing accountants to review and modify before finalizing. When a payment is recorded, the corresponding AP liability is reduced, and the cash or bank account is updated. Aging reports provide visibility into outstanding liabilities segmented by time buckets, aiding cash flow planning.

## 5. Accounts Receivable (AR)
Accounts Receivable tracks amounts owed by customers. Customer master records store billing addresses, credit limits, and default revenue accounts. Credit management is integral: sales orders are checked against customer credit limits, and warnings are issued when thresholds are exceeded.

The AR workflow mirrors AP but from the sales perspective. A sales order initiates the process, capturing the customer’s request for goods or services. Upon delivery confirmation, an invoice is generated, debiting Accounts Receivable and crediting a revenue account. Receipts are recorded when customers pay via cash, check, or bank transfer. The system supports early-payment discounts, write-offs for uncollectible amounts, and dispute handling where invoices are partially or fully contested.

AR aging reports mirror their AP counterparts, showing outstanding receivables categorized by how long they have been due. Cash flow forecasting benefits from this visibility, allowing management to identify delinquent accounts quickly. Integrations with inventory ensure that stock levels are updated when goods are shipped, closing the loop between operational and financial data.

## 6. Inventory & Items
Inventory management revolves around stock keeping units (SKUs), item categories, and warehouse locations. Each SKU includes attributes like description, unit of measure, valuation method, and reordering parameters. Items can be grouped into categories for reporting or pricing purposes.

Transactions affecting inventory are captured in a stock ledger that supports receipts, issues, and transfers. The MVP adopts a FIFO costing method, valuing stock based on the order in which items were received. When goods are received from a vendor, the inventory quantity and value increase, with corresponding postings to the GL. Stock issues, whether for sales or internal consumption, decrease inventory based on the oldest available cost layers. Transfers between locations generate two movements: a reduction in the source location and an increase in the destination, preserving overall quantities.

Reports include real-time stock levels, valuation summaries, and aging analyses that highlight slow-moving or obsolete items. Inventory ties closely with both AP and AR; goods receipt triggers the creation of vendor invoices, and sales deliveries reduce stock while generating revenue recognition events.

## 7. Procure-to-Pay
Procure-to-Pay (P2P) weaves together purchasing and financial settlement. It begins with a purchase requisition, where internal stakeholders request goods or services. Approved requisitions evolve into purchase orders (POs), formalizing commitments to vendors. POs are tracked until goods are received, at which point inventory is updated and a goods receipt note is created.

The goods receipt forms the basis for vendor billing. When an invoice arrives, the system cross-references the PO and goods receipt to verify quantity and price alignment—a process known as three-way matching. Discrepancies trigger exception workflows for investigation. Once validated, the invoice flows through the AP module for approval and posting to the GL. Payment processing closes the loop, with each step retaining references to prior documents for full traceability.

By structuring P2P as a coherent workflow, the ERP ensures that operational purchasing decisions translate smoothly into financial records. Data duplication is minimized, and audit trails enable reviewers to trace every payment back to its originating requisition.

## 8. Order-to-Cash
Order-to-Cash (O2C) encapsulates the customer-facing revenue cycle. It starts with a sales order capturing product, quantity, price, and delivery expectations. The system checks inventory availability and customer credit before confirming the order. Partial shipments are supported, allowing sales to fulfill what is in stock while back-ordering the remainder.

Upon delivery, a delivery note is generated, reducing inventory and confirming that goods are in transit or have arrived at the customer site. Invoicing follows, with revenue recognized and AR updated. Receipt of customer payments completes the cycle, clearing outstanding invoices. Returns and refunds are handled via credit notes and reverse logistics processes that restock inventory where appropriate.

O2C provides end-to-end visibility from initial quote to cash receipt. Sales performance metrics, such as conversion rates and average days sales outstanding, become available once the full cycle is captured within the system.

## 9. Reporting
Reporting transforms raw transactions into actionable insights. The MVP includes foundational financial statements—Trial Balance, Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet—derived directly from the GL. Parameterized by date range and account filters, these reports can be generated on demand. They support drill-down capabilities, enabling users to navigate from summary figures to underlying journal entries.

Operational reports round out the offering. AR and AP aging highlight pending receivables and payables, respectively. Stock valuation reports provide visibility into inventory value by item and location, while stock ledger reports chronicle every movement for audit purposes. All reports can be exported to PDF or spreadsheet formats without requiring external libraries or services, thanks to embedded open-source components.

## 10. Security & Access Control
Security is enforced through role-based access control. Roles such as Admin, Accountant, Procurement, Sales, and Auditor dictate which modules and actions a user may access. Permissions operate at both module and record levels; for example, an Accountant may view and post journal entries but not alter vendor master data. 

Every transaction logs metadata about who created, approved, and posted it. Approval workflows enforce segregation of duties, particularly for high-risk actions like vendor payments or manual journal entries. Audit logs are immutable and stored in append-only tables, ensuring that attempts to tamper with history are detectable.

Password policies, session timeouts, and optional two-factor authentication round out the security posture. Because the system is self-contained, administrators have full control over user provisioning without relying on external identity providers.

## 11. UI/UX Philosophy
Despite the breadth of functionality, the user interface adheres to a philosophy of guided simplicity. Dashboards surface key performance indicators such as cash balances, outstanding receivables, payables due, and stock levels. Each module offers wizard-like workflows that lead users through complex tasks step by step, reducing training overhead.

Contextual help is accessible via a built-in panel that references offline documentation. Tooltips and inline hints explain field purposes and validation rules. The design favors responsive layouts so that the system remains usable on different screen sizes, though the MVP targets desktop use primarily. Keyboard shortcuts and default field values expedite data entry for power users.

## 12. Deployment & Packaging
The MVP is distributed as a single artifact. For small installations, this may be a desktop application bundling an embedded SQLite database. For multi-user scenarios, a server-client architecture is recommended: the server package includes the application runtime and PostgreSQL, while clients connect via web browser or thin desktop client.

Deployment scripts handle database schema creation, seed data insertion (including a sample chart of accounts and demonstration inventory items), and admin user provisioning. Upgrades use versioned migration scripts, allowing administrators to update the system without data loss. Backups are facilitated by built-in tools that export both database snapshots and configuration files.

## 13. Testing & QA
Quality assurance spans unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Unit tests validate business rules such as enforcing double-entry balance or preventing negative stock levels. Integration tests simulate workflows like Procure-to-Pay, ensuring that data flows correctly across modules and that the GL receives the appropriate postings. End-to-end tests use mock data to emulate real-world scenarios, including edge cases like partial shipments or disputed invoices.

User acceptance testing (UAT) scenarios are documented and provided within the package, allowing organizations to verify functionality against their own processes. Automated test suites can be run offline, aligning with the self-contained philosophy. Continuous integration is intentionally omitted from the MVP due to its offline nature, but hooks are provided for teams that wish to integrate with their own CI systems.

## 14. Extensibility & Roadmap
While the MVP focuses on core financial and inventory management, the architecture anticipates future growth. Planned modules include Payroll for managing employee compensation, Fixed Assets for tracking depreciable property, Tax Engines for jurisdiction-specific calculations, Multi-Currency support for international operations, Manufacturing for bill-of-materials and work orders, and Consolidation for multi-entity reporting.

Extensibility is achieved through well-defined module boundaries and internal APIs. Event listeners allow modules to react to system-wide events without direct coupling. For example, a future tax module could listen for invoice postings and automatically calculate tax liabilities. Configuration files expose hooks for custom fields, validation rules, and report templates, minimizing the need for core code modifications.

By laying a solid foundation, the MVP positions itself as a platform rather than a monolithic application. Organizations can adopt the system knowing that their initial investment will support future enhancements without a complete rewrite. The roadmap balances pragmatism with ambition, recognizing that a sustainable ERP ecosystem grows iteratively while remaining grounded in reliable fundamentals.


## 15. Implementation Considerations & Conclusion
Translating this blueprint into a working system requires pragmatic choices around tooling, conventions, and project governance. The MVP adopts a monorepo structure to simplify dependency management and version control. Source code is organized by module, mirroring the functional boundaries described earlier. Shared utilities—such as logging, configuration parsing, and error handling—reside in a common library folder to prevent duplication while keeping module interfaces clean. Developers are encouraged to follow a test-driven approach, writing unit tests alongside business logic to ensure that edge cases are codified early.

Data modeling is an important foundation for implementation. Each core entity—accounts, vendors, customers, items, orders—is represented by a dedicated table with surrogate keys to avoid natural key volatility. Foreign key constraints enforce relational integrity, and enumerated fields use lookup tables rather than hard-coded values. Soft deletes are avoided; instead, records can be deactivated but remain in the database to preserve history. To support the audit requirements, every table includes created_by, created_at, updated_by, and updated_at columns, with triggers to populate them automatically.

Transaction management deserves special attention in an offline-first system. The application wraps each business event in a database transaction, ensuring that either all related changes commit or none do. This approach prevents situations where a journal entry posts without the corresponding inventory movement or invoice update. For deployments using SQLite, which has limitations around concurrent writes, the application serializes high-contention operations and provides user feedback when a resource is locked. PostgreSQL installations benefit from more robust concurrency control, enabling multiple users to process transactions simultaneously.

Error handling is standardized across modules. The system differentiates between user-facing validation errors and internal exceptions. Validation errors provide actionable messages, such as indicating which field is missing or why a transaction cannot be posted. Internal exceptions are logged with stack traces and diagnostic context, aiding developers during troubleshooting. A global error boundary in the UI ensures that unhandled errors degrade gracefully rather than crashing the application.

Configuration management balances flexibility with simplicity. All settings are stored in a human-readable file, such as YAML or TOML, located within the application directory. Administrators can define company information, fiscal calendars, approval thresholds, and feature toggles without recompiling the system. The configuration file is version-controlled alongside the database schema, making environment recreation straightforward. When the application starts, it validates the configuration and reports any inconsistent or deprecated options.

Documentation accompanies the codebase. A docs folder houses markdown guides that mirror the structure of this blueprint, providing step-by-step instructions for installation, module setup, and common workflows. These documents are bundled into the application’s help system, ensuring consistency between developer and end-user materials. Developers contribute to documentation as part of the definition of done for each feature, preventing knowledge silos.

Licensing and community strategy influence the long-term viability of the ERP. The MVP is released under a permissive open-source license, encouraging adoption and collaboration. Contribution guidelines outline coding standards, review processes, and the project’s code of conduct. A public issue tracker allows users to report bugs or request enhancements, fostering a transparent feedback loop. While the MVP is self-contained, the community aspect ensures that improvements and security patches can be shared without relying on proprietary channels.

From a deployment perspective, the project provides container images and native installers. Containers offer a reproducible environment for server deployments, bundling the application, database, and necessary runtime dependencies. Native installers cater to desktop users by packaging binaries and resources in a familiar format for Windows, macOS, or Linux. Both distribution methods leverage a command-line setup tool that initializes the database, loads seed data, and guides administrators through creating the first user.

As the MVP evolves, backward compatibility becomes a key concern. Versioned APIs and database migrations allow systems to upgrade without disrupting operations. The development roadmap includes deprecation policies: features slated for removal are flagged in documentation and release notes several versions in advance. Automated tests guard against regressions, and a dedicated upgrade guide accompanies each major release, detailing steps required for a smooth transition.

In conclusion, this blueprint outlines a self-contained ERP MVP that marries foundational accounting rigor with practical deployment strategies. By emphasizing offline capability, modular architecture, and clear audit trails, the system offers organizations a trustworthy core on which to build their operational processes. The narrative approach highlights not only what to build but why each decision matters, equipping developers and stakeholders with the context needed to deliver a coherent product. While the scope is intentionally constrained to ensure feasibility, the extensible design and community-oriented licensing invite continuous improvement. With disciplined implementation and collaborative stewardship, this MVP can grow into a robust alternative to heavyweight ERP suites, providing autonomy without sacrificing functionality.

Sustaining momentum after the initial release involves more than code. The team should establish regular review cadences to assess feature requests, prioritize bug fixes, and evaluate the health of the project community. Metrics such as issue resolution time, test coverage trends, and user adoption rates inform strategic decisions about where to invest effort. By treating the MVP as a living product rather than a one-off deliverable, stakeholders cultivate an ecosystem that adapts to evolving business needs while preserving the core commitment to autonomy and transparency.
